          # Starting March 2021, we've been experiencing occasional hangs after
          # the tests finished running successfully. This reduces the time
          # CircleCI waits with no output, the idea being that we won't have to
          # wait for a long time to relaunch the build, which, unfortunately,
          # is what we have to do in those occasions.
