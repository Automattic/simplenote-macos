// Strip Debug Symbols During Copy
//
// Specifies whether binary files that are copied during the build, such as in a Copy
// Bundle Resources or Copy Files build phase, should be stripped of debugging symbols.
// It does not cause the linked product of a target to be strippedâ€”use
// `STRIP_INSTALLED_PRODUCT` for that.

// Controls whether assertion logic provided by `NSAssert` is included in the
