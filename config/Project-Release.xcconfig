// Strip Debug Symbols During Copy
//
// Specifies whether binary files that are copied during the build, such as in a Copy
// Bundle Resources or Copy Files build phase, should be stripped of debugging symbols.
// It does not cause the linked product of a target to be strippedâ€”use
// `STRIP_INSTALLED_PRODUCT` for that.
COPY_PHASE_STRIP = YES

// Debug Information Format
//
// The type of debug information to produce.
//
// * DWARF: Object files and linked products will use DWARF as the debug information
// format. [dwarf]
// * DWARF with dSYM File: Object files and linked products will use DWARF as the debug
// information format, and Xcode will also produce a dSYM file containing the debug
// information from the individual object files (except that a dSYM file is not needed
// and will not be created for static library or object file products). [dwarf-with-dsym]

// Swift Compilation Mode
//
// This setting controls the way the Swift files in a module are rebuilt.
//
// * Incremental: Only rebuild the Swift source files in the module that are out of
// date, running multiple compiler processes as needed.
// * Whole Module: Always rebuild all Swift source files in the module, in a single
// compiler process.
SWIFT_COMPILATION_MODE = wholemodule

// Swift Optimization Level
//
// * None: Compile without any optimization. [-Onone]
// * Optimize for Speed: [-O]
// * Optimize for Size: [-Osize]
// * Whole Module Optimization: [-O -whole-module-optimization]
