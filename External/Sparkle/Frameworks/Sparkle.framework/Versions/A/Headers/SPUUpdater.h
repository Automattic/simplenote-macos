/*!
 Initializes a new SPUUpdater instance
 
 This does not start the updater. To start it, see -[SPUUpdater startUpdater:]
 
 Note that this is a normal initializer and doesn't implement the singleton pattern (i.e, instances aren't cached, so no surprises)
 This also means that updater instances can be deallocated, and that they will be torn down properly.
 
 Related: See SPUStandardUpdaterController which wraps a SPUUpdater instance and is suitable for instantiating in nib files
 
 @param hostBundle The bundle that should be targetted for updating. This must not be nil.
 @param applicationBundle The application bundle that should be relaunched and waited for termination. Usually this can be the same as hostBundle. This may differ when updating a plug-in or other non-application bundle.
 @param userDriver The user driver that Sparkle uses for user update interaction
 @param delegate The delegate for SPUUpdater. This may be nil.

/*!
 Starts the updater.

 This method checks if Sparkle is configured properly. A valid feed URL should be set before this method is invoked.
 Other properties of this SPUUpdater instance can be set before this method is invoked as well, such as automatic update checks.

 If the configuration is valid, this method may bring up a permission prompt (if needed) for checking if the user wants automatic update checking.
 This method then starts the regular update cycle if automatic update checks are enabled.

 One of -checkForUpdates, -checkForUpdatesInBackground, or -checkForUpdateInformation can be invoked before starting the updater.
 This preschedules an update action before starting the updater. When the updater is started, the prescheduled action is immediately invoked.
 This may be useful for example if you want to check for updates right away without a permission prompt potentially showing.

 This must be called on the main thread.

 @param error The error that is populated if this method fails. Pass NULL if not interested in the error information.
 @return YES if the updater started otherwise NO with a populated error

 Checks for updates, and displays progress while doing so.
 
 This is meant for users initiating an update check.
 This may find a resumable update that has already been downloaded or has begun installing, or
 this may find a new update that can start to be downloaded if the user requests it.
 This will find updates that the user has opted into skipping.

 Checks for updates, but does not display any UI unless an update is found.
 
 This is meant for programmatically initating a check for updates.
 That is, it will display no UI unless it finds an update, in which case it proceeds as usual.
 This will not find updates that the user has opted into skipping.
 
 Note if there is no resumable update found, and automated updating is turned on,
 the update will be downloaded in the background without disrupting the user.

 Begins a "probing" check for updates which will not actually offer to
 update to that version.
 
 However, the delegate methods
 SPUUpdaterDelegate::updater:didFindValidUpdate: and

 so you can use that information in your UI.
 
 Updates that have been skipped by the user will not be found.

 an update check can be done to check if there's an already started update that can be resumed.

 Set the URL of the appcast used to download update information. Using this method is discouraged.

 To avoid this, you should consider instead implementing
