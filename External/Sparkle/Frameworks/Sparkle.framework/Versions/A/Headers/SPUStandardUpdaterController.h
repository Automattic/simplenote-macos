/*!
 A controller class that instantiates a SPUUpdater and allows binding UI to it.
 
 This class can be instantiated in a nib or created using initWithUpdaterDelegate:userDriverDelegate:. The controller's updater targets the application's main bundle
 and uses Sparkle's standard user interface. Typically, this class is used by sticking it as a custom NSObject subclass in an Interface Builder nib (probably in MainMenu).
 
 The controller creates an SPUUpdater instance and allows hooking up the check for updates action and menu item validation. It also allows hooking
 up the updater's and user driver's delegates.
 
 This controller class may not be valuable to you if:
 * You want to control or defer the instantiation of an SPUUpdater, or don't want to be tied into a nib's instantiation, or don't want to use a nib
 * You want to target a bundle that's not the main bundle
 * You want to provide a custom user interface, or perhaps one that provides little-to-none
 * You don't want to use a convenience class that provides very little glue ;)
